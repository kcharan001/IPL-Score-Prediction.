The *IPL Score Prediction Using Machine Learning* project is all about using data and technology to predict scores during IPL matches. By analyzing historical match data—like the number of overs played, wickets lost, and player performances—we can forecast scores with impressive accuracy.  

We used Python and popular libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data handling, and Matplotlib and Seaborn to make the data come alive through visualizations. For predictions, we built models using Linear Regression, and to boost accuracy, we added Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms.  

This project combines cricket and machine learning to give meaningful insights for fans, analysts, and fantasy league players. It's a great example of how data can transform the way we understand and enjoy sports!
